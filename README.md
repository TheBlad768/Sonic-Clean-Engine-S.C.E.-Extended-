## Current issues

1. S.C.E. uses Kosinski Plus algorithm, but [Flex2](https://github.com/kirjavascript/Flex2) program does not support Kosinski Plus Module. Therefore, Flex2.json project file is partially useless.

#### Alternative programs:
- [mdcomp](https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp/releases)
- [ClownMapEd](https://github.com/Clownacy/ClownMapEd/releases)
- [FW-KENSC-ShellExt](https://github.com/MainMemory/FW-KENSC-ShellExt/releases)

2. S.C.E. uses two-byte IDs chunks for layout. Official [SonLVL](https://github.com/sonicretro/SonLVL) can open level projects, but it only supports one-byte ID. You just won't be able to use more than 0x100 chunks.
You can use ProjectFM's alternative version of SonLVL that supports two-byte IDs and you can use more 0x100 chunks for levels.
